// without them differs in ways that census cannot see: it holds no comment and
// no SequenceNode.Entries. Leaving out a removed node took a "-" no entry hands
// over, a "..." no document holds and every comment for a removed node's text,
// and 27 documents no caller had touched came back wrong or were refused before
// this census was kept.
//
// The 30 recorded on 2026-09-11 were there before any of that, and all 30 held
// one shape: a block sequence whose values carry no token of their own, written
// as layout where it should have been copied. A lone "-" came back "- " and
// "---\n-\n" came back "---- \n".
// TestVerbatimRebuildsABlockSequenceOfImplicitNulls holds those shapes now, and
// the count has stood at 0 since 2026-09-13.
