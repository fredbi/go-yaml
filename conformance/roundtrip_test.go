// This matters more here than it would in another YAML library. Reversible
// transformation -- read a document, change one value, write it back with
// comments and anchors intact -- is one of the reasons this library exists, and
// these are the documents where it does not hold.
//
// It is empty: every document the YAML Test Suite offers and the parser accepts
// survives the cycle unchanged, comments and anchors included. The list used to
// be forty long, and two thirds of it had one cause -- rendering placed a child
// at the column its token was read at, so every cycle added a little more
// indentation and no document ever settled. Laying documents out by depth
// removed that cause and everything that followed from it.
//
// The ratchet runs both ways: a document that stops surviving fails because it
// is missing from here, and one that starts surviving fails because it is still
// listed. An empty ledger is re-earned on every run.
