  The codec: turning YAML into Go values and back.

  Marshal and Unmarshal, the options that steer them, struct tags, anchors,
  comments and errors.

Everything on these pages is reachable from
[`codec`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-openapi/go-yaml/codec). The root
package re-exports `Marshal`, `Unmarshal`, `ToJSON` and `FromJSON`; anything
with options lives in `codec`.
