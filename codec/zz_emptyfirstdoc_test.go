// Both converters take the first document of a stream, empty or not.
//
// "---" over "---" over "b: 2" is a stream of two documents, the first empty.
// The decoder read the first and gave null; ToJSON wrote {"b":2}, which is the
// second -- so the library gave both answers to the question of what converting
// a stream should mean. They had always agreed on a stream whose first document
// has content, so it was the empty one they parted company over.
//
// ✅ Settled on 2026-09-13 in favor of the decoder's reading: ToJSON converts
// the first document whatever it holds. jsonWriter counted the document bodies
// it saw, and a document written as nothing between its markers hands over no
// node, so the count never moved for it. parser.Step.Document now says which
// document a node belongs to, and the writer reads that instead.
// codec/zz_tojsonstream_test.go holds the whole contract; what this file keeps
// is the agreement between the two converters, which is what found it.
//
// Found on 2026-09-13 by the stream axis, once the corpus carried a document
// suffix into TestToJSONMatchesTheValueConverter.

// TestFixedBothConvertersTakeTheFirstDocument pins both sides.
