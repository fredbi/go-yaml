// TestAnInlineMapIsFilledByBothDecodePaths covers a `,inline` map, which
// go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 fills with the entries no field of the struct claims.
//
// The two decode paths disagreed. The tree decoder filled the map; the walk
// left it empty and reported success, because a walk meets an entry once and
// has to place it then, and readFields.flat holds only the names an index path
// reaches. A map has no such name.
//
// walkableType now refuses a struct that inlines a map, so the tree reads it.
// The refusal is settled from the Go type before the parse, which is the point
// of asking there: a walk that gives up halfway has read the document for
// nothing.
