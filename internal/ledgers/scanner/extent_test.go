// extentLedger records the documents whose token extents do not tile the source.
//
// The extents are meant to follow one another with nothing between and nothing past the end, so
// src[previous end:this end] gives each token back as the document wrote it, indentation and all. That is the property
// TestOriginsTileTheSource asserts in internal/scanner, and the one github.com/go-openapi/go-yaml/transform stands on:
// its pieces tile the source, so a transform that changes nothing gives the document back byte for byte.
//
// It holds nothing: all 12,375 documents the parse accepts tile, measured 2026-09-11.
//
// It held four until scanRawFoldedChar started a plain scalar continued by a "- " line where its text does. Each of
// the four ended a String token 9 to 45 bytes past the end of the document, and "- single multiline\n - sequence
// entry\n" was the smallest: 37 bytes, with the scalar reported at Offset() 21 and EndOffset() 56. The start was wrong
// too, since the scalar begins at offset 2. The fix corrected the Offset with the end, so offsetMissLedger's String
// count stayed where it was, and transform's walker.extent stopped clamping an extent into the document.
//
// It held six before a "<<" cut out of a plain scalar as a merge key stopped starting a MappingValue token inside
// the one before it: seed/17860 writes "{<<<: ...}" and seed/10138 " i    <<:". It held seven before that, while
// removeRightSpaceFromBuf cut the space closing "&a1 " off the origin and put the Comment after it one byte inside the
// anchor. cursor.originTrimmed counts those bytes back into the end.
//
// offsetMissLedger reads a token's text back through the extents, so a token whose extent breaks gets an empty
// origin there and is counted nowhere. A document that stops tiling has to be recorded here.
//
// The documents are keyed by the first four bytes of the SHA-256 of their text. jsonLedger, jsonTokenLedger and
// decodeLedger key a document by its test suite case name, which is the convention here, and it runs out at the fuzz
// seeds: a seed's index moves whenever the corpus is generated again. A hash keys the text itself, so growing the
// corpus adds an entry only when a document that breaks the tiling is genuinely new.

// break the extents on the way to being refused, almost all of them on the Invalid token an error carries, which is
