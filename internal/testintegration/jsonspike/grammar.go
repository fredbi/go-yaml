// Package jsonspike is the corpus idea, rehearsed on a grammar small enough to
// check by eye.
//
// JSON is the right rehearsal for three reasons. Its grammar has fifteen-odd
// productions and no propagated parameters, so the coverage vector collapses
// from production x context to production alone and the selection idea can be
// tested without the hardest open question in the YAML design. Its official
// test suite is the product of a deliberate hunt for parser disagreements
// across dozens of implementations, so beating it means something. And there is
// exactly one bug that suite missed in our own lexer, which gives the spike a
// falsifiable question rather than a demonstration.
//
// Nothing here depends on YAML. That is deliberate: the recognizer, the
// coverage hook and the corpus builder are expected to move to their own repo,
// and this package is the proof that the grammar package carries no YAML in it.
