//
// They are written from the same understanding and could drift apart silently:
// the generator builds a document meaning to exhibit a property, the tagger
// reads bytes and reports what it finds, and nothing otherwise forces the two
// to agree. A shape whose property goes undetected is a document the corpus
// will score as though the question were settled.
//
// Detection may find more than was intended -- a UTF-16 mark is also not valid
// UTF-8, and saying so is right -- so the check is containment, not equality.
