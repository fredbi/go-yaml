// Each pair is one document written at two indentations. The grammar says the
// same thing about both -- same verdict, same productions, same contexts -- so
// without the indentation classes they produce the same signature, the
// minimizer reads them as one route, and one of them is discarded before any
// parser sees it.
//
// That is the wrong document to throw away. Indentation is the largest thing a
// verdict cannot see, and it is where this library and this recognizer have
// both had their bugs, so a corpus that keeps one representative per route is
// keeping the evidence for everything except the defect most likely to be
// there.

// TestTheSignatureStillGroups is the cost side of the same trade.
//
// A signature is an equivalence class and the minimizer keeps a quota per
// class, so a signature made fine enough stops grouping anything: every
// document becomes its own class, the quota never binds, and nothing is
// minimized. Binning n and m rather than recording them is what keeps that from
// happening -- the columns themselves are unbounded, and a bucket per column
// would be a bucket per document.
//
// So the property is asserted from both sides on documents built for it, rather
// than inferred from a corpus statistic. Documents differing only in what a
// scalar says take the same route and must group; documents differing only in
// how far they are indented do not and must not.

		// indentations genuinely do group. Nearer in they do not, and should
		// not: a derived n+1 lands one side of a boundary or the other, so

		// it is where the grammar still changes its mind.
