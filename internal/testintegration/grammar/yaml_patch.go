// spaces between a sequence entry's "-" and a collection written on the same
// line. The two block collection rules say the same thing with an explicit
// (set), so this is a gap in the data rather than in the reading of it.

// Left alone, m is whatever the enclosing block sequence detected, and the rule
// then recognizes exactly those documents where the two happen to agree. So
// "- - a: x" is accepted, where the enclosing m is 1 and one space follows the
// dash, and "- &z\n  - a: x" is rejected, where the enclosing m is 2 and one
