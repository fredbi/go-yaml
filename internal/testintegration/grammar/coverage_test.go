// coverage vector would be an underestimate shaped by the memo table's hit
// pattern rather than by the document -- and a minimizer selecting on it would
// keep and discard documents for reasons having nothing to do with the grammar.
//
// It does not, because a hit can only happen where the same rule was already
// evaluated at the same position under the same env, and that first evaluation
// entered everything beneath it. The counts differ; the set does not. This
