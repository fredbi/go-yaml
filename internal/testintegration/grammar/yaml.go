// YAML is the YAML 1.2 grammar, compiled once from the productions the spec
// publishes as a data structure, with the prose-only rules patched in.
var YAML = MustCompile("YAML 1.2", yamlSpec, yamlPatches()...)

// yamlPatches are the places where compiling the published grammar faithfully
// would not compile YAML faithfully.
//
// All but one are rules the spec states in prose and never puts in the grammar
// file. They are asserted rather than attempted: see [Patch].
//
// The exception is patchPlainQuestionMark, and it is exceptional in kind rather
// than in degree: it departs from the published grammar on the evidence of
// three implementations rather than on the evidence of the prose. Kept
// separable and labeled, so that nobody has to work out later which patches
// rest on what.
//
// They are applied in order, and one pair depends on it: patchBlockHeaderEnd
// works on the shape patchBlockHeader leaves.
//
// The largest group is a single omission repeated. The spec writes each
// indicator character into the grammar and then constrains what may follow it
// in the surrounding prose, so five rules read an indicator that the language
// does not let them read. That pattern is worth more than the list: it says
// where to look next.
//
// Two of them are what the calibration measures and four are not. Every
// indicator lookahead turns out to refuse only what the separation after it
// already refused, so they change no verdict, only the route the recognizer
// takes to reach one. See whitespaceAhead. Keeping the count straight matters:
// a patch adopted on the strength of a score it did not move is a patch nobody
// has actually checked.
//
// The calibration does not measure patchPlainQuestionMark either -- no fixture
// of the Test Suite writes a lone "?" against a flow indicator -- which is why
// it took a corpus of a hundred thousand documents and a third parser to find.

// Rules yaml-reference-parser patches and this does not, with why.
//
// Their patch file is the closest thing to a second opinion on this material,
// so a place we do not follow it is worth writing down rather than leaving as
// an absence. All of them are mechanism: things their combinators need and ours
// do not, which would cost documents if adopted as though they were rules.
//
//   - c-b-block-header(n), c-indentation-indicator(n), c-chomping-indicator
//     with no t: they thread the block header's results downward as arguments
//     where we hand them back through the env. Two spellings of one mechanism.
//
//   - (m>0) and (->m) forms on the block collection rules, in place of the
//     (set) the grammar file writes. The same detection, declared differently.
//
//   - s-l+block-collection's second and third alternatives are adopted, but
//     their reason is not ours: theirs compensates for an optional a PEG cannot
//     reconsider. Ours needs them because c-ns-properties is a rule and a rule
//     commits to its first success. Same shape, and worth knowing why.
//
//   - l-yaml-stream taking l-document-prefix once rather than repeatedly. The
//     problem it solves is that l-document-prefix matches the empty string, so
//     repeating it is an unbounded loop over nothing -- which our repeat
//     combinator already stops, on the first step that consumed no input.
//     Adopting it anyway would refuse two consecutive byte order marks, which
//     the published grammar admits and no prose in the spec forbids.
//
//     ✅ Settled against libfyaml 1.0.0b1 on 2026-09-09, and not adopting is
//     right: it reads a document opening with two marks rather than refusing
//     it. It takes the prefix once, the way their patch does, so the second
//     mark is content -- "\ufeff\ufeffa: 1" comes back keyed "\ufeffa". Two
//     readings of one document, and both accept it, so a patch that made us
//     refuse would be wrong whichever reading is right.
