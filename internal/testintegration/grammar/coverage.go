// Coverage records which productions a recognition entered, and in which
// context.
//
// # Why this is not the compiler's coverage
//
// The recognizer is a closure interpreter: every production is a slot holding
// an expr built from shared combinators, so one copy of choice's machine code
// serves around a hundred distinct choices. Go's edge instrumentation saturates
// on it almost at once and can offer no gradient at all toward a production
// nothing has reached. Exploring the recognizer's *code* is not exploring the
// *grammar*; the code has stopped telling them apart.
//
// So production coverage is measured semantically, at [invoke], which is the
// single funnel every production entry passes through.
//
// # Production by context
//
// The bucket is a production paired with the context it was entered in, not the
// production alone. The same rule genuinely decides differently in block-in and
// in flow-key, and a vector that could not tell those apart would call a
// grammar covered while a whole half of it had never run.
//
// The indentation parameters n and m are deliberately left out. They are
// unbounded, so they need a binning nobody has designed, and the omission is a
// known gap rather than a judgement that indentation does not matter -- it is
// exactly where both this library and this recognizer have had their bugs.
//
// # Attempts and successes are different questions
//
// invoke fires on backtracked attempts too. "The grammar considered this rule
// here" and "this rule matched here" are both worth knowing and are not the
// same thing, so they get separate counters rather than a shared one.
//
// # Indices are not portable
//
// A bucket index is a production id, and ids are assigned per compiled
// [Grammar]. They are stable across processes -- productions are numbered in
// name order for exactly this reason -- but they are not stable across grammar
// *revisions*. Persist documents, never vectors.
