// Reach is the set of production-by-context buckets a recognition starting
// somewhere can enter, computed from the grammar rather than measured from a
// corpus.
//
// # Why a denominator has to be computed
//
// A coverage vector holds one bucket per production per context, and nearly all
// of them are empty because nearly every production is only ever entered in one
// or two contexts: nothing calls s-l+block-collection in flow-key, and nothing
// ever will. YAML 1.2 has 211 productions and seven contexts, so the vector has
// 1,477 slots and a corpus reaching every bucket it could would still show as a
// third full.
//
// Quoted against that, "559 buckets reached" says nothing at all -- not whether
// the corpus is nearly done or barely started, and not which direction work
// should go. A target needs the number of buckets that exist.
//
// # Exact rather than approximate
//
// This is a fixed point over the call graph, carrying the context along each
// edge, and it is exact because the grammar leaves it no room not to be: the
// context at a call site is written as one of three things, a literal context
// name, the variable c, or in-flow(c), and all three are decidable without
// running anything. A rule that does not declare c inherits its caller's, which
// is what the compiled call does too.
//
// Two places need care, and both narrow the answer rather than widening it. A
// (case) on the context takes exactly the arm for the context it is in, so the
// other arms' calls are not reachable through it. And a (flip) with no arm for
// the context it is handed cannot return one, so nothing past it is reachable
// -- the recognizer panics there, which is the same statement said louder.
//
// # It is checked, not trusted
//
// A static denominator that is wrong is worse than none, because it reports
// progress that is not there. [Coverage.Impossible] is the falsification: any
// bucket a real recognition entered that this says is unreachable is a defect
// here, and the corpus is large enough to find one.
