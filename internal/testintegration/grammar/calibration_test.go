// declared is a case of the YAML Test Suite where the recognizer knowingly
// disagrees with the fixture, with the reason it does.
//
// A declared departure is not an excuse: it is the difference between a
// disagreement somebody has looked at and one nobody has. The list is asserted
// exactly -- a case that starts agreeing is as much a failure as one that stops,
// because an entry nobody removes is how a fixed defect goes on being described
// as a known one.
//
// Both entries are the same kind of thing, and it is not a kind a patch can
// reach. Each states a constraint over the directives of one document, which
// means keeping a table and consulting it -- and a grammar has no table. They
// are not oracle bugs but the first two members of a category: rules the spec
// states, that no syntax can express. The corpus handles those by enumerating
// the shapes they take and labeling the documents by construction, which is
// where these two are headed.

// verdicts, so an oracle that is wrong anywhere produces fixtures that accuse a
// parser of defects it does not have -- and a frozen corpus, unlike a live
// oracle, cannot retroactively correct itself.
//
// The suite is a hand-written sample, so agreement here is weak evidence and
// disagreement is strong evidence. It is wired in as a test rather than run as
// a script for the same reason the corpus is regenerated and diffed: a
// measurement nobody repeats stops being a measurement.
