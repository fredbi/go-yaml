// Shapes the generator found that no longer diverge.

// A fixed defect leaves this much behind: the document that showed it, now
// asserting the behavior that is correct. It is worth keeping separately from
// the fix's own tests, because the generator reached these through a path
// nobody chose, and the same path will be walked again.

// TestFixedSingleQuotedKeyKeepsItsEscaping: a mapping key read from a
// single-quoted scalar is written back with its quote still doubled.
//
// The doubling used to be dropped, so a key holding one quote came back
// holding none of its escaping and the rendered document no longer parsed -- a
// valid document rendering to an invalid one. The same string in a value
// position was unaffected, which is what placed it in how keys were written
// rather than in single-quoted scalars, and the fix's own tests cover the value
