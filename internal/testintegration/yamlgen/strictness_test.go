// TestValidDocumentsTheLibraryRefusesAreStillRefused pins what is known, the
// same way TestWronglyAcceptedDocumentsAreStillWronglyAccepted does for the
// opposite direction.
//
// The validity is asserted and the refusal is only reported. That the document
// is YAML 1.2 is this suite's claim and has to keep holding; that the library
// will not read it is the library's business, and the day it does is the day
// the entry gets deleted rather than the day this test goes red.
//
// # Two syntax oracles, and neither of them a loader
//
// The validity is asserted against grammar.Stream and against the reference
// parser, which are generated from the specification's grammar by different
// toolchains -- ours from yaml-spec-1.2.json, the Perl one from yaml-grammar --
// and neither of which builds a value.
//
// That last part is the point. libfyaml and go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 both construct
// as they read, so a refusal from either may be the loader declining to hold
// something rather than the parser refusing the document. An entry here was
// written on 2026-09-13 saying both refused "{a: !!bool &x}", which they do --
// because no boolean can be built from an empty node. Asked with "!!str" they
// read it, and the document had been valid all along. A Strictness is a claim
// about syntax, so it is asserted against the sources that answer about syntax.
