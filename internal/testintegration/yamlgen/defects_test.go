// Shapes the generator found that still diverge.

// Each one pins today's behavior rather than the correct behavior, so that a
// fix breaks the test that says it was broken. The corresponding entry in
// [yamlgen.Ledger] is what keeps the property tests from failing on it
// meanwhile; when both go, the case moves to fixed_test.go.

// The first two came from [yamlgen.Style.Break] on 2026-09-03, the axis that
// writes one document with LF, CRLF and a lone CR. Neither shape is exotic and
// neither was reachable before it. The third came from [yamlgen.DeepDocument]
// the same day, and is the one no verdict could have found: the documents parse
// correctly and cost quadratic time doing it.
