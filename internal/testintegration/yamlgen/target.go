// The Go type a document is read into, built from the value the document was
// written from.
//
// # Why the destination is an axis
//
// Every property in this package decodes into an `any`, and so does every
// corpus-driven decode in yamlcorpus and in conformance/. Reading into an `any`
// and reading into a Go type are two paths through codec: one walks the token
// stream, the other gathers a tree and fills fields by reflection. They can
// disagree silently, and three defects were found living on the second one in a
// single afternoon of reading it.
//
// So [TargetFor] builds a type that fits the drawn value -- a struct with a
// field per mapping key, a slice of the item type, the obvious scalar -- and
// the property decodes the same document twice and compares. The value is
// already known; this reads it back through the other path.
//
// # What it will not build, and why that is not a hedge
//
// A struct field names its key in a `yaml:"..."` tag, and a tag is a string
// with commas for options. So a key holding a comma cannot be named at all, and
// neither can the empty key -- `yaml:""` asks for the field's own name. Two
// keys differing only in case cannot be named separately either, since field
// matching is case-insensitive.
//
// A mapping holding any of those falls back to map[string]any, which is a
// destination the decoder treats differently from `any` and worth reaching in
// its own right. The fallback is reported by [TargetFor] rather than silent:
// see [Target.Structs].

// TargetShape is which destination is built, where a document has more than
// one that fits.
//
// The shape is drawn rather than derived, because a document does not choose
// its destination -- a caller does, and the three below are the three a caller
// writes. Reading one document into all of them and comparing is what says
// whether the reflection path agrees with itself.
