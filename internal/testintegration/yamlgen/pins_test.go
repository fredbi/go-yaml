// TestEveryLedgerEntryNamesItsPin holds [yamlgen.Divergence.Pin] to a test that
// exists, so the link between an entry and the one document that reproduces it
// is checked rather than assumed.
//
// It was assumed until 2026-09-13, and two entries had no pin at all. The link
// matters because of what the tally cannot do: an entry drawn past
// suspectAfter times with no divergence is either fixed or matching a family it
// is not in, and the count says only that something is wrong. The pin says
// which -- it runs the document the entry was written for, so if it still
// diverges the predicate wants narrowing and if it does not the defect is
// fixed.
//
// The names are read out of defects_test.go with go/ast rather than grepped,
// for the reason TestTheParserVocabularyGapIsMeasured reads the parser's
// messages that way: a comment mentioning a test is not a test.
