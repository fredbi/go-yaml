// The cost of a parse, measured as a curve rather than as a number.
//
// Every other test in this package asks what a document means or whether it is
// one. None of them notices a parser that takes 67 seconds over 400,000
// brackets, because it reads them correctly -- so the parse can go quadratic
// with the whole corpus green and no verdict anywhere disagreeing. The shapes
// come from [yamlgen.DeepDocument]; the measurement is here.

// costSpan is how much bigger the large document is than the small one.
//
// Eight, not two. The two curves are told apart by a factor that compounds, so
// a wide span separates them far past the noise: over eight times the depth a
// linear parse costs about the same per byte and a quadratic one about eight
// times as much.
const costSpan = 8

// costCeiling is what a linear parse may cost per byte at costSpan times the
// depth.
//
// Measured on 2026-09-03, the five linear shapes land between 0.9 and 1.3 and
// the two quadratic ones at 5.4 and 5.1. Anything between 2 and 4 separates
// them; 2.5 leaves twice the observed spread for a slower or noisier machine.

// cost eight times as much per byte.
