// The rest of this package asks whether the library is too strict, and cannot
// ask the opposite: [yamlgen.Emit] writes valid documents by construction and
// TestEveryEmittedDocumentIsValidYAML holds it to that, so the library
// accepting one is never news. [yamlgen.Mutate] makes documents that are not
// YAML, the recognizer says which, and the library is asked anyway.
//
// The hunt is behind a flag because it finds something within a few thousand
// draws and will do until the list below is empty:
