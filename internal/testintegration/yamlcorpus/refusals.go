// Comparing a refusal by what it says, not only by the fact of it.
//
// # Why the fact of a refusal is not enough
//
// Everything else in this package asks whether a document is refused. Six of
// the eight defects found across the parser rewrite lived in *why*: six
// documents that had been refused with `'@' is a reserved character` came back
// refused with `found an invalid token`, and no verdict anywhere changed. A
// corpus of verdicts is blind to that by construction, and so is the comparison
// against a second parser -- it ignores wording on purpose, because two parsers
// word things differently.
//
// # Two ways to hold a message, and what each is for
//
// [Refusals] pins a phrase to a document. It is hand-written and small, it
// needs no corpus, and the failure hands a fixer a document to paste. Use it
// for the complaints worth naming.
//
// [RefusalSignature] is the other half and the one that crosses with the rest
// of the generator. It reduces a message to the parser's own words -- position
// gone, quoted text gone, numbers gone -- so that the same complaint about
// different documents is one signature. Counting the distinct signatures a
// corpus provokes measures how much the parser can still tell you: 54 over the
// smoke tier's refused documents. The parser's whole vocabulary, and the part
// of it nothing reaches, are measured by TestTheParserVocabularyGapIsMeasured
// rather than counted by hand here
// while every verdict stayed exactly where it was.
//
// # What a signature deliberately throws away
//
// The wording. `sequence end token ']' not found` and `sequence end token '}'
// not found` are one signature, and rephrasing a message does not change its
// signature at all. That is the point: a message is a stronger claim than a
// verdict and drifts faster, so pinning whole messages would fail every time
// somebody improved one. What survives is how many different things the parser
// can say, and a collapse in that number is the regression worth catching.

// RefusalSignature reduces an error to the parser's own words.
//
// The substitutions run in order and each one removes something the document
// contributed rather than the parser: the position, then any quoted run, then a
// tag handle, then a number, then the text after a colon, then anything glued
// to a substitution that the earlier steps could not reach -- a mapping key
// holding a quote of its own, which is what `mapping key "a"b" already defined`
// leaves behind.
//
// So a refusal message must not contain an apostrophe. The quoted-run step
// reads it as opening a quoted span and eats everything to the next one: `a
// block scalar's content is not indented as far as its header's indentation
// indicator states` signs as `a block scalar_s indentation indicator states`.
// Single quotes in a message are placeholders for what the document
// contributed, and an apostrophe is an accidental one.
