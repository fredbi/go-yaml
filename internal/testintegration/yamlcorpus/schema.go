// Schema resolution: what a plain scalar means.
//
// # Why this is the largest open surface in YAML
//
// A plain scalar carries no tag, so what it denotes is decided by a resolution
// step the grammar knows nothing about. YAML 1.2 defines three answers --
// failsafe, where everything is a string; JSON, which recognizes what JSON
// recognizes; and core, which is generous -- and YAML 1.1 gave a fourth,
// still widely implemented because a decade of documents were written against
// it. Every one of these is a legitimate thing for a parser to be.
//
// So none of it is a rule and all of it is a stance. What a corpus can do is
// make the position visible: enumerate the scalars the schemas disagree about,
// carry a tag for each disagreement, and let a table say which answer it gives.
// Judging the answer is not the corpus's job, and a corpus that judged would be
// asserting one schema and calling the others defects.
//
// # The one thing worth saying out loud
//
// A disagreement here changes a *value* and never a verdict. "0777" is a valid
// document under every schema, and it means 511 under one and 777 under
// another. Nothing that scores accept-or-refuse will ever notice, which makes
// this the second family -- after cycles -- that a verdict corpus is
// structurally blind to.
