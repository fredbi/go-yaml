// Directives: the prelude, and the four separate errors the spec states about
// it.
//
// # Why a grammar sees none of them
//
// The grammar recognizes a directive line perfectly well. What it cannot do is
// count them, remember which handles it has already seen, or compare a version
// against the one the processor implements -- so every document below is one it
// accepts, the four errors included. A production has no memory, and every rule
// here is about what came earlier on the page.
//
// # The scope rule is the one that catches people
//
// Directives belong to the document that follows them and to no other. A handle
// declared before the first document of a stream is not declared for the
// second, which reads as a stray restriction until you notice it is the only
// rule that makes a stream a sequence of independent documents rather than one
// long file with a shared header.
