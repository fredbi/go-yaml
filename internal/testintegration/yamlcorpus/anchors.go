//
// The patterns are built around real generated material rather than fixed
// literals, so that each one carries a document's shape and differs from it in
// exactly one reference. That is the whole reason they are patterns and not a
// list of hand-written fixtures: a hand-written fixture exercises the rule and
// nothing else, and the interesting failures are the ones where the rule
// interacts with what is around it.
//
// # Why entries and not a whole document
//
// A pattern has to put an anchor somewhere and an alias somewhere else, both at
// the top level of the same document. Splicing them into an arbitrary document
// would mean re-indenting it, and re-indenting YAML is exactly the operation
// this project refuses to guess at -- a block scalar's content, a stated
// indentation indicator and a compact sequence entry all mean something
// different afterwards. So a pattern composes sibling entries at column zero
// instead, where nothing needs moving, and Document supplies the rest.
