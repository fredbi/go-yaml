// Merge keys: a construct no version of the specification we test against
// defines.
//
// # Why this is a stance and cannot be anything else
//
// "<<" is a YAML 1.1 type, tag:yaml.org,2002:merge, and YAML 1.2 dropped it.
// So a 1.2 parser reading "<<" as an ordinary key is not being lax and a parser
// merging is not being lenient -- they are answering different questions
// correctly. Measured rather than assumed: go.yaml.in/yaml/v3 v3.0.5 merges
// whatever the document declares, and libfyaml 1.0.0b1 gives {"<<": {...}} back
// as a member name -- until the document writes "%YAML 1.1", where it merges.
// Neither is wrong.
//
// libfyaml's rule is the one this library took in 8acf11b, which the merge
// question was settled without knowing: "<<" resolves under the version the
// document declares, so the merge happens under "%YAML 1.1", under
// parser.WithYAMLVersion(YAML11), or where the document writes "!!merge". These
// documents declare no version and read the way libfyaml reads them.
// yamlgen.Written carries both answers for a generated merge document, and
// stance.Table.Reads is how a replay picks between them.
//
// There is therefore nothing here for a rule to settle, and a corpus that
// settled it would be picking a version of the language and calling everyone
// else defective. That is the failure this whole layer exists to avoid, and
// merge keys are the cleanest example of it in YAML.
//
// # It changes verdicts, not only values
//
// The temptation is to file merge under "means something different" and move
// on. It is more than that: a parser that merges has to *reject* documents a
// parser that does not merge reads happily, because "<<: 1" asks it to merge a
// scalar and there is no such operation. So the same bytes are a valid document
// to one conforming consumer and an error to another, which is exactly what a
// stance is for and exactly what a single stored verdict could not carry.
