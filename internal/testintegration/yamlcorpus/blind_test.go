// actually diffed on: a class name is a string built from an error message, and
// two builds of a library that reject the same document for the same reason
// routinely word it differently. The case names come from the corpus, which is
// the same artifact in both runs, so they join where the messages do not.

// Examples are bytes rather than names, for the reverse reason: a name is only
// resolvable by somebody holding this corpus, and the whole point of a
// reduction is to hand the document to something else.

// It replays a corpus against whatever library the module resolves to and

// that are still open; run in a worktree of an older commit, where the module's
// replace directive points at that older library, it reports what the corpus
// would have said had it existed then. The difference between the two reports
// is the measurement.

// The verdict goes to [yamlcorpus.GoYAMLParser] and the value to
// [yamlcorpus.GoYAML], for the reason spelled out on those tables: a decoder
// reads a whole stream into Go values and cannot say at which stage it stopped,
// so a syntax refusal and a resolution refusal look the same to it. A corpus
// that recorded the grammar's verdict is talking about syntax.
//
// # What it measured, against the parser as it was before this branch
//
// Replayed against the library at the commit the branch's fixes are parented
// at, and diffed against the same replay here. Written down rather than
// asserted, for the reason [TestMeasureK] gives: an assertion would fix the
// answer to whatever this library happens to do today.

// two, and the interesting half is small: nine are documents the generator
// cannot write -- a byte order mark, an explicit key, a flow collection as a
// key, a tag, a directive -- and every one of them the grammar labels
// correctly, so they are a generator's gap and not an oracle's. The other
// eleven are outside what a verdict and a value can see at all: eight are
// about the text a document is written back as, one is a stream whose later
// documents are dropped where only the first one's value is compared, and two
// are API surfaces a corpus never calls.
