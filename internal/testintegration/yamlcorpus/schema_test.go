// resolved is what this library makes of each scalar, measured rather than
// derived, and checked in so that a change to it fails here.
//
// This is the whole point of the family. Which schema a parser implements is
// not a defect either way -- failsafe, JSON, core and 1.1 are all legitimate
// things to be -- so nothing here is scored. What a corpus can do is make the
// position visible and hold it still, and a table nobody re-measures does
// neither.
//
// Read down the column and the position is the YAML 1.2 core schema, whole.
// It was a hybrid until 2026-09-04 -- 1.2 for booleans, sexagesimals and
// timestamps, 1.1 for a leading zero, for underscores and for binary, and
// stricter than either for "1e3" -- because it fell out of a
// normalize-then-strconv routine rather than out of a reading of any schema.
//
// YAML 1.1 is not gone: a document says "%YAML 1.1" or a caller passes
// parser.WithYAMLVersion, and resolved11 below records what that gives.
