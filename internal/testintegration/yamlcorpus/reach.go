// Documents whose only job is to enter a production nothing else enters.
//
// # A different kind of case
//
// Every other family here exists because of a question: what an alias resolves
// to, what a scalar denotes, what a tag names. These exist because of a
// *number*. The reachability analysis says a stream can enter 605
// production-by-context buckets, the rest of the corpus enters all but a
// handful, and these are the handful.
//
// That makes them worth keeping and worth being honest about. They are not
// evidence of anything a parser is likely to get wrong. They are the difference
// between a corpus that covers the grammar and one that covers nearly all of
// it, and the gap is where nobody is looking by definition.
//
// # Why the generator cannot produce them
//
// Each names something yamlgen's emitter has no way to write. Three are
// presentation it does not offer -- an explicit key, a version directive, a
// keep chomping indicator on a root scalar -- and one is a document that has to
// be *invalid* in a particular way, which a generator of valid documents will
// never draw.
//
// The first three could become Style axes, and would be better as Style axes:
// an axis crosses with every other axis, where a fixture is one document. That
// is a change to yamlgen and a larger one than it looks, since each axis has to
// preserve the value it is writing. Recorded rather than done.
