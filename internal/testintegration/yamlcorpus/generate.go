// Generating documents for the corpus.
//
// # Drawing from yamlgen, deterministically
//
// The values and the styles are yamlgen's, drawn through rapid's Example, which
// is documented to produce a value deterministically from a seed. That is what
// an artifact needs and what a *rapid.T inside a property check could not give:
// a corpus claims a seed reproduces it byte for byte, and rapid owning the
// stream would make the claim unverifiable.
//
// Example carries a caveat -- it is meant for examples rather than for property
// tests -- and one more this file has to live with: nothing promises the values
// are the same across rapid versions. That is survivable here because it is
// *detected*. The stored corpus is regenerated and diffed on every run, so a
// rapid upgrade that moved the documents fails loudly and gets a deliberate
// regeneration and a Generator bump, rather than quietly producing a different
// corpus for whoever built it last.
//
// The toolchain used to be a second undetected axis. rapid.String draws from the
// standard library's unicode tables, which carry a Unicode version, so Go 1.27
// drew different characters from Go 1.25. yamlgen.Runes owns its ranges by
// number now -- see yamlgen/runes.go -- and yamlgen's own digest test fails
// before this one does.
//
// # Why yamlgen's generator and not one written here
//
// The first version of this file drew its own values, from an alphabet chosen
// for characters the grammar finds awkward. It was worse in the way that
// matters: it produced no anchors at all. yamlgen's Values wraps its trees in
// withAliases, so about a quarter of the documents carry an anchor and an alias
// -- and its awkwardStrings covers everything that alphabet did and adds the
// schema boundaries and the document markers besides.
//
// The mutations keep their own generator. Breaking a document is not something
// yamlgen has a seeded form of, and a plain PCG is the whole of what it needs.

// Entry is one generated document, with where it came from.
type Entry struct {
	// Name identifies it, and is stable for a given seed.
	Name string
	// Src is the document.
	Src []byte
	// Value is what it means, known because the value came first. Nil for a
	// mutant, which means whatever the mutation left behind.
	Value yamlgen.Value
	// Mutation names how it was broken, empty for a document emitted whole.
	Mutation string
	// Features are the constructs the emitter wrote into it.
	//
	// Empty for a byte mutant, and that is the honest answer rather than a
	// missing one: the mutation may have deleted the bracket the document was
	// labeled for, and nothing here can tell which mutations did. It is the
	// same reasoning that caps a mutant's VerdictAt at parsing.
	Features []stance.Feature
	// Readings is what the document denotes under each reading that disagrees
	// with the core schema, empty where they all agree.
	Readings map[string]any
	// Tags are the rules this document breaks, where it was broken on purpose
	// and the break is therefore known.
	//
	// Only the value-level breaks carry them. A byte mutation cannot say what
	// it broke, which is why its acceptance is claimed for parsing and no
	// further -- see suite.Case.VerdictAt.
	Tags []stance.Tag

// Generate draws documents from a seed and breaks each of them.

// Meaning first, then presentation: a value is drawn, a style is drawn, and the
// document is what the emitter writes. That order is what makes the expectation
// free -- generating text first would leave nothing to compare a decode against.
