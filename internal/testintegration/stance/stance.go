// Package stance records what a parser has decided about the things its
// specification leaves open.
//
// # Why a corpus cannot store a verdict
//
// Every specification worth testing against leaves some questions to the
// implementation. RFC 8259 lets a parser limit the range and precision of
// numbers, and calls the meaning of an unpaired surrogate escape
// unpredictable. YAML 1.2 admits three encodings where a given library may
// want one. Neither is a defect in the specification and neither is settled by
// a grammar.
//
// So a corpus that stored "this document must be accepted" would be storing
// one parser's opinion as though it were the language, and would mark a
// perfectly conforming parser wrong for holding a different one.
//
// What a corpus stores instead is the grammar's verdict and a set of [Tag]s
// naming the implementation-defined properties the document exhibits. A [Table]
// turns those into an expectation at the moment of replay. One corpus then
// scores our parser, our parser under different options, and somebody else's
// parser, without any of them being privileged.
//
// # Nothing here is language-specific
//
// The tag vocabulary belongs to the language being tested. The machinery for
// declaring a position and deriving an expectation does not, and lives here so
// that JSON and YAML share it.

	Speaks Vocabulary
	// At is how far this consumer takes a document, and it is a floor rather

	//
	// A floor because a stage is not always a property of the tag alone. A lone
	// surrogate escape is detectable while lexing and some parsers wait until
	// they construct a string to care; both are conformant, and the one that
	// notices earlier is not answering a different question. So the vocabulary
	// records the earliest stage a question can arise and a consumer declares
	// how far it goes, which makes every question at or below that line one it
	// is answerable for.
	//
	// The zero value is Parse, which is the right default: a table that says
	// nothing is a table about a grammar.
	At Stage
	// Reads names the resolution of plain scalars this consumer implements:
	// "yaml-1.2-core", "yaml-1.1". Empty means it reads whatever the corpus
	// states its meanings under, which is the specification's own default.
	//
	// [Table.Expect] does not consult it, and cannot: a verdict is the same
	// under every reading. "0777" is a valid document whichever schema is
	// asked, and the schemas disagree only about what it denotes. So this is
	// what a replay matches a stored meaning against, and a consumer whose
	// reading a case does not state is left unscored on the value rather than
	// failed against somebody else's answer.

	// It is the answer at [Parse] and at no other stage. A document may be well
	// formed and fail to compose, or compose and fail to construct, and neither
	// is recorded here -- those are carried by [Doc.Tags] and resolved against
	// a consumer's stage. The name predates the stages and is kept because it
	// is a stored field in every published artifact.
	//
	// Normalizing first is what keeps a tolerated property from costing a
	// scoreable case. A parser that skips a byte order mark is reading the

// Expect says what a parser holding this stance should do with a document, and
// why.
//
// The reasoning, in the order it is applied:
//
//   - A property belonging to a stage past where this consumer stops is not its
//     question, and is skipped before anything else. A lexer is not wrong about
//     numbers it never converts.
//   - A rule the language settled outright decides first, and the stance does
//     not get a vote. Declining it -- declaring Either -- leaves the document
//     unscored, which is the honest answer for a parser that does not
//     implement the check. That holds for a rule declaring a construct legal
//     as much as for one demanding a rejection: a consumer that cannot read
//     verbatim tags at all is not answering the question either way. Claiming
//     Accepts on a rejection is reported by [Rules.Contradicted] and ignored
//     here.
//   - A property the parser refuses forces a rejection, whatever else is true.
//     Refusing on purpose is conformant.
//   - A property the parser has not ruled on, or declines to guarantee, makes
//     the document no evidence at all. Silence is reported rather than read as
//     consent.
//   - Bytes the oracle cannot read at all, carrying a property this parser
//     tolerates, are no evidence either: what they denote depends on a decoder
//     this package does not have. A parser lenient about encodings needs its
//     input decoded before a grammar can say anything about it.
//   - A refusal by the grammar decides, whatever stage the consumer reaches:
//     a document that does not parse does not compose either.
//   - An acceptance decides only as far as the case claims. See
//     [Doc.VerdictAt]: acceptance does not propagate the way refusal does.
