// stands in for all four:
//
//   - addBuf appends the byte and moves notSpaceCharPos to the end of the buffer. Its rule about leading whitespace
//     cannot apply, the run holding no space or tab, so the whole run is appended and the mark goes to the end.
//   - addOriginBuf moves originEnd by one byte per character, which is what skipOrigin does for the run at once. It is
//     one byte per character because the run is ASCII by construction.
//   - progressColumn moves the column and the index by one apiece, likewise.
//   - updateIndent, reached with isFirstCharAtLine already false -- the first character of the line's content cleared
//     it before the switch handed here -- sets the indent state to Keep and returns. Setting it once stands for
//     setting it n times.
