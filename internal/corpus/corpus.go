// Package corpus generates the synthetic documents the benchmarks run on.
//
// It lives under testdata so that it is not part of the published module, and
// it is shared so that a number measured in one package means the same thing as
// a number measured in another.
//
// The shapes are chosen for what they expose, not for realism:
//
//   - FlatMap is wide and shallow. Sibling count at one level is the axis that
//     super-linear parsing shows up on, and a depth guard does not bound it.
//   - NestedDoc is the shape of a real OpenAPI specification. It understates
//     the width effect -- the sibling count at any one level stays low -- which
//     is exactly why both shapes are needed.
//   - Anchored and BlockScalars cover the two constructs that constrain
//     streaming: anchors must be retained until the document ends, and block
//     scalars are where the scanner does its least regular work.
